# Introduction

## Motivation

Sports Stats - MLB, Sports Game Simulations, Personal Sports League Record Keeping (Papers from Childhood)
NBA - Steph Curry and 2015-2016 Warriors, Why I think NBA is the best league in sports
Investing - Sports Betting as an investment??

## Goals

The main goal of this project is create an automated system that collects data about NBA games and predicts point spreads at a level that is consistently profitable.

### Secondary Goals

* Learn more about the NBA and uncover interesting stats and trends concerning the NBA and betting data surrounding it.
* Acquire new data skills and improve upon my current knowledge.

<br/><br/>

# Data Acquisition

Web Scraping - Scrapy, Splash, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Chrome Dev Tools (Inspect)
API Calls - 

<br/><br/>

# Data Storage and ETL

Image of Diagram showing data sources and how they connect.
Combining both historic and live data from various sources into a single clean and verified database.

<br/><br/>

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Dataprep.eda for AutoEDA

Interesting Questions:
* Vegas Point Spread vs. Actual Game Spread over time. How has Vegas improved at predicting?
* Biggest Outliers Vegas vs. Actual
* Home vs. Road over time
* Home/Road against the spread over time
* How much is being at home worth over time, Both vegas lines and actual results
* Team Quality vs. Against the Spread results. Are good, average, or bad teams more likely to over-perform the vegas spread?
* Actual Team Record vs. Expected Record, Which is a better predictor of vegas lines and actual results?

### Average Point Spread Error Per Game Over Time
