            <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

            <h2 id="project-goal">Project Goal</h2>
            <p>Create a <strong>Comprehensive</strong> and <strong>Profitable</strong> System for Predicting the
                <strong>Outcomes</strong> of NBA Games.
            </p>

            <h4>Comprehensive Approach</h4>
            <p>Under the 'comprehensive' aspect, the project will explore and test all plausible prediction methods,
                ensuring an evolving scope and prioritization based on the utility of the results. This creates a
                potentially never-ending project scope, focusing on the most impactful methods first.</p>

            <h4>Profitability Focus</h4>
            <p>The 'profitable' aspect aims to transcend theoretical exercises, focusing on generating direct financial
                gains or actionable insights for profitable betting decisions. However, consistent success in
                outperforming betting markets presents challenges, including the potential erosion of profitability if
                widely accessible. Therefore, while aiming for profitability, the project will be strategically managed
                to balance public access and financial viability.</p>

            <h4>Broad Definition of Outcomes</h4>
            <p>Initially, the project will focus on predicting the final score margins. In its long-term vision, it will
                expand to cover other betting domains like over/under and player props, embracing a broad definition of
                'outcomes'.</p>

            <p>This project is not just an analysis or a static model, but a continuously evolving resource aimed at
                setting new standards in predictive analytics for NBA games.</p>

            <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
            <p>NBA betting uniquely aligns with my interests, knowledge, skills, and goals, making it an exciting and
                beneficial project for me - a fortunate convergence of passions!</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>NBA Enthusiast:</strong> My fascination with professional basketball, particularly from an
                    analytical and financial perspective, started in 2015. Growing up in Illinois, I chose to support
                    teams like the Packers (NFL) and the Cardinals (MLB), diverging from my family's Chicago favorites.
                    The Kobe Lakers of the late 2010s initially drew my attention, but the electrifying 2015-2016 NBA
                    season, with its memorable moments and teams like the Warriors and the Spurs, truly captivated me.
                    Today, I enjoy following teams like the Spurs for their game-changing talents and occasionally tune
                    into the Warriors and Nuggets, complementing my viewing with insightful basketball podcasts.</li>

                <li><strong>Data Science Career:</strong> Data science entered my life out of necessity rather than a
                    traditional educational path. I view it as a versatile toolkit more than a profession, focusing on
                    practical application over theoretical knowledge.</li>

                <li><strong>Sports Analytics Enthusiast:</strong> A lifelong interest in sports analytics began with
                    baseball and expanded into other sports. My childhood was filled with video games of various sports
                    leagues, where I focused more on simulating seasons and managing teams than playing the games
                    themselves. This passion extended to keeping imaginary stats and scores while playing sports in my
                    yard, laying the groundwork for my current interests.</li>

                <li><strong>Investment Background:</strong> My educational background in finance, influenced by my
                    uncle, initially led me down a traditional path. However, the post-recession job market shifted my
                    focus towards applying financial concepts to diverse and emerging markets. This experience has given
                    me unique insights into potential investment opportunities in fields like sports betting, beyond
                    conventional investment avenues.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>
            <p>How do we predict the outcome of an NBA game? What are the inputs, and how do they interplay to yield
                accurate predictions? From a data science viewpoint, the challenge lies in identifying the optimal
                feature set and designing an effective model architecture.</p>

            <p>Given the structured nature of sports and the abundant public data, the approach to this problem can vary
                significantly. The vast amount of data available for a single NBA game outstrips what is typically found
                in fields like finance, manufacturing, or IoT in terms of both breadth and depth. This abundance is both
                a blessing and a challenge: the options are plentiful, but selecting the right ones and managing them
                effectively is crucial.</p>

            <p>Below is the current framework for organizing this project. It outlines the proposed methodology, data
                sources, and model structure. This framework is open to evolution, and I welcome suggestions for
                refinement or alternative approaches.</p>

            <h3 id="how-to-predict-a-nba-game-result">How to predict an NBA game result?</h3>
            <p>Organizing and conceptualizing approaches to NBA game predictions involves multiple layers, each
                influenced by data sources and model architectures. We've divided this complex question into four
                distinct levels. Each level can function independently for predictions or be aggregated as part of a
                higher-level framework.</p>

                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Discussion -
                    Frameworks</a></p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Player Prediction Framework:</strong> This level focuses on individual player performance,
                    aiming to quantify a player's quality. A simple example is estimating a team's score by summing up
                    the players' average points per game.</li>

                <li><strong>Player Interaction and Synergy Framework:</strong> This framework centers on how players
                    perform in various combinations on the court. It explores questions like how certain player pairings
                    or lineup compositions affect overall team performance, highlighting the idea that the whole can be
                    greater than the sum of its parts.</li>

                <li><strong>Team Prediction Framework:</strong> This is the conventional level for predicting game
                    outcomes, asking how one team compares to another. It's also the level at which betting lines are
                    typically set, like "GSW -8 vs SAC +8" or "PHX -210 vs DAL +240".</li>

                <li><strong>Game Prediction Framework:</strong> This comprehensive level includes all factors that could
                    impact game results: game location, referee decisions, schedule effects (back-to-back games, travel,
                    rest days), organizational incentives (tanking, playoff seeding), coaching styles, etc. It also
                    encompasses more ephemeral data like betting trends, line movements, and player availability
                    (injuries, rest days).</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 id="data-point-examples">Data Point Examples</h3>
            <p>Deciding which data points to pursue is a complex yet crucial part of this project. The challenge lies in
                identifying the most relevant and impactful types of data from a plethora of available sources. This
                includes determining the optimal format and granularity of the data, whether it be raw data, traditional
                stats, advanced metrics, or even public perception and power rankings.</p>

            <p>Initially, the project aimed to collect a broad array of data categories, but it quickly became evident
                that each data point carries its own set of challenges, especially in terms of acquisition and
                management. Consequently, a more strategic approach is needed, focusing on the most beneficial data in
                terms of time and resources.</p>

            <p>Data acquisition has been the most time-consuming phase so far, further complicated by the time series
                nature of sports data. Predictive metrics vary in their utility based on the timeframe considered - be
                it team history, season-to-date stats, recent performance, or data from the last game. Additionally,
                machine learning and deep learning models require point-in-time data, which poses its own set of
                challenges in terms of availability and structuring.</p>

            <h1 id="current-goal">Current Goal: Focusing on Point Spread and Team Prediction</h1>
            <p>The overarching objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated system to tackle the challenging
                goal of predicting NBA game outcomes. Initially, the focus is narrowed down to predicting the point
                spread using the team prediction framework. This approach aligns with the most common method in betting
                markets and offers a tangible starting point.</p>

            <p>The aim is to surpass the accuracy of betting lines set by Vegas, which predict the game winner and
                margin. While these lines are a strong benchmark, there's an average discrepancy of over 9 points per
                game compared to actual results, highlighting a significant room for improvement. The graph below
                illustrates the evolution of this average discrepancy over time.</p>

            <p>However, before delving into the methodology, it's important to acknowledge a unique challenge in this
                endeavor. Vegas, with its extensive resources and data, sets a high bar for predictive accuracy.
                Simultaneously, the public availability of Vegas lines offers a valuable data source for modeling. This
                dual nature creates a tight performance range, making it a delicate balance to measure real progress and
                achieve tangible improvements.</p>

            <h1 id="project-structure">Project Structure: Data Science Workflow and Infrastructure</h1>
            <p>The project's architecture is built around a relational database, integrated with a series of data
                processing and model training steps. The core database, currently hosted on Amazon RDS, utilizes
                PostgreSQL, but the system is designed to be adaptable to other platforms. The daily workflow involves
                updating the database with the latest data, followed by data processing, feature engineering, model
                training, and ultimately, using the model for predictions to inform betting strategies. This entire
                process is encapsulated within a web application and dashboard, providing a comprehensive and
                user-friendly interface. Below is a flowchart that outlines this data science workflow.</p>

        <!-- Data Sourcing and Storage -->
        <div class="container my-5">
            <h1 id="data-sourcing-and-storage">Data Sourcing and Storage: Building the Foundation</h1>
            <p>The data sourcing and storage phase is arguably the most challenging and time-intensive aspect of this
                project. The data needed falls into three primary categories:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Game Data:</strong> This includes fundamental details like dates, times, teams, and scores
                    of the games.</li>
                <li><strong>Betting Market Data:</strong> Crucial for the betting aspect, this includes various betting
                    lines and odds.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Data:</strong> Comprising the data points used for making predictions, this is the
                    backbone of our modeling.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>While acquiring current data is relatively straightforward, the real challenge lies in sourcing
                historical data for training and testing machine learning and deep learning models.</p>
            <p>Initially, the approach involved using web scraping tools like Scrapy to gather data at minimal costs.
                However, this method proved to be laborious and fraught with complexities. To streamline the process,
                the project will transition to using paid data services, allowing a sharper focus on modeling and
                prediction. Below is a flowchart detailing the data sourcing and storage process, along with links to
                the current and future data sources and the relevant project code.</p>

                Analytics</h1>

            <img src="images/data_engineering_flowchart_2.png" alt="ETL" class="img-fluid mx-auto custom-image" />

            <p>This section delves into the critical steps of data preparation and feature engineering, which form the
                backbone of our predictive modeling. The main steps include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Loading Data:</strong> Retrieval of data from games and raw features tables.</li>
                <li><strong>Initial Feature Engineering:</strong> Adjusting raw metrics before merging, like
                    transforming points per game into relative league averages and rankings.</li>
                <li><strong>Merging Data:</strong> Combining games and feature data into a single record for each game,
                    with a unique game_id as the primary key.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Merge Feature Engineering:</strong> Creating game-level features after merging, such as
                    differences in team statistics or rest days.</li>
                <li><strong>Saving Records:</strong> Storing each game's data as a record in the all_features_json
                    table, which includes a game_id and a JSON object with all features for that game. This table is
                    pivotal for model training and testing.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Important considerations in this phase:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The all_features_json table primarily serves to integrate an extensive, evolving feature list into a
                    relational database framework. It is usually converted into a DataFrame using pandas for further
                    processing.</li>
                <li>A key challenge is avoiding data leakage during merging and feature engineering. It’s crucial to
                    meticulously manage the dates for data merging (e.g., using the previous day's data for a game) and
                    to accurately calculate rolling features based on the correct historical games.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>An in-depth analysis of the Vegas miss data revealed a consistent average miss amount across various
                categorizations. This uniformity, while somewhat unexpected, underlines the robustness of the Vegas
                lines. A hypothesis about higher miss amounts early in the season due to data scarcity and uncertain
                team dynamics was explored. While the first month showed the highest average miss, the difference was
                not markedly significant. Weekly analysis further indicates that the miss average fluctuates randomly
                around the overall mean.</p>

            <p>In addressing the challenge of selecting from a vast array of potential features for the modeling
                process, methods such as correlation, mutual information, and feature importance ranking were employed.
                However, no single feature emerged as a standout predictor. This result may reflect the inherent
                complexity of accurately predicting game outcomes against Vegas lines. A significant ongoing aspect of
                this project is identifying the most effective feature set for prediction accuracy.</p>

            <p>This project's modeling stage is divided into two distinct approaches. The first involves leveraging
                AutoML to explore a range of possibilities in the basic tabular format of the problem. The second
                approach focuses on developing a custom model architecture, tailored specifically to the nuances of this
                challenge.</p>

                class="img-fluid mx-auto custom-image" />

            <p>As indicated by the results, consistently outperforming the Vegas lines remains a challenge. This is not
                unexpected, given the complexity of the task and the additional hurdle of overcoming the vig (the
                bookmaker's charge). While a fully successful model has yet to be realized, the AutoML process has
                proven to be an enlightening and potentially valuable first step in many ML/DL projects.</p>

            <h3 id="custom-model-architecture">Custom Model Architecture</h3>
            <p>The journey towards a custom model architecture initially centered around a traditional data science
                approach – combining various features from different sources. While this approach aligns with
                conventional methods and may still hold potential, it faces several challenges, including complex data
                collection and potentially mirroring the algorithms used by line setters. To move beyond these
                limitations and add an element of innovation, I am exploring a second approach, which includes the
                following key requirements:</p>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Minimal Data Collection:</strong> Streamlining data sourcing to the essentials, aiming for
                    maximum impact with minimal data, thereby reducing time and resource investment.</li>
                <li><strong>Wider Applicability:</strong> Extending the scope to cover more comprehensive outcomes,
                    moving beyond standard predictions like point spreads or over/unders.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Modeling System:</strong> Developing a system that is not only a learning tool but
                    also potentially novel compared to the methods used by odds setters.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal Human Decisions:</strong> Reducing the reliance on human decision-making to minimize
                    errors and the limitations of individual expertise.</li>

        <h1 id="bet-decisions">Bet Decisions</h1>

        <p>This crucial segment of the project involves the strategic application of model predictions in real-world
            betting scenarios. The process begins with the integration of predictive outputs from our models with
            supplementary data that was not directly factored into the model. This additional data can include current
            trends, team news, player conditions, and other relevant information that might influence game outcomes. The
            aim is to enhance the predictive power of our models by combining their statistical insights with real-time
            contextual data.</p>

        <p>Once the comprehensive decision-making dataset is assembled, it feeds into a sophisticated bet and bankroll
            management system. This system is designed to optimize bet recommendations based on a balance of risk and
            reward, considering factors like betting odds, potential returns, and the overall health of the betting
            bankroll. The ultimate goal is to provide well-informed, data-driven betting recommendations that maximize
            profitability while mitigating risk.</p>
